# Security Force Monitor: Backend [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/security-force-monitor/sfm-cms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/security-force-monitor/sfm-cms)

## OS Level dependencies

* Docker and Docker Compose

## Development

### Basic setup

Clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:security-force-monitor/sfm-cms.git
    cd sfm-cms

Next, create a local settings file. If you're on the Blackbox keyring for the repo,
decrypt the development settings file:

    blackbox_cat configs/settings_local_dev.py.gpg > sfm_pc/settings_local.dev.py

If you're not on the keyring, you can copy the example settings file and set
your own secret variables:

    cp sfm_pc/settings_local.example.py sfm_pc/settings_local.dev.py

Replace `OSM_API_KEY` in `settings_local.py` with a Wambacher cliKey. Generate a key [here](https://wambachers-osm.website/boundaries/) by enabling OAuth, selecting a boundary, checking CLI, hitting Export, and looking at the generated URL. You'll also need to set the `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` in order to load maps.

Build application container images:

    docker-compose build

Once you have container images, there are two ways that you can load data into your database.

### Option 1: Load a database dump

The standard data loading process for the app can take many hours to complete. If you're working with a developer who already has a database set up, you can save time by having them make a dump of their database for you:

    docker-compose run --rm app pg_dump -Fc -h postgres -U postgres -d sfm -O > sfm_empty.dump

Then, load this dump into your own database:

    docker-compose run --rm app pg_restore -h postgres -U postgres -d sfm -O sfm.dump

Once the dump has been restored, move on to the step `Set up the search index` below.

### Option 2: Load data via management commands

The standard way to load data into the app is to use the app's management commands for loading data. Start by updating the `Countries` models: 

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py update_countries_plus

Next, import OSM data:

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py import_osm
    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py link_locations

Import entity data from Google Drive:

    # This command will look for valid credential data for a Google Drive Service Account
    # in sfm_pc/management/commands/credentials.json. The Service Account needs to have
    # access to all the relevant files. If you're on the keyring for this project, run
    # the follow Blackbox command before running the Makefile:
    # blackbox_cat configs/credentials.json.gpg > sfm_pc/management/commands/credentials.json
    docker-compose run --rm app make import_google_docs

Clean up unused Locations:

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py clean_locations --batch

### Set up the search index

Build and start the Docker image for the Solr server:

    docker-compose up --build solr

Open up another shell and create the search index:

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py make_search_index

Create an admin user:

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py createsuperuser

Start the web server:

    docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py runserver

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and sign in with your email and password.

## Translations

We use [Django translation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/) together with [Rosetta](https://github.com/mbi/django-rosetta) and [django-complex-fields](https://github.com/security-force-monitor/complex_fields).

Template translations appear inside `trans` tags, like so:

```python
{% trans "Countries" %}
```

Model field and form error translations appear inside `_()` hooks, as such:

```python
from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

...

field_name = _("End date")
```

This nomenclature signals that the text can be translated into the user's specified language. But first, someone with language expertise must provide the appropriate translation. Happily, Django can extract all translatable strings into a message file:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py makemessages -l es
docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py makemessages -l fr
```

This command generates a `.po` file for each language. Rosetta facilitates the editing and compiling of these files. Go to `/rosetta/`, and view the snippets of code, requiring translation, organized by language. Then, translate some text, click "Save and translate next block," and Rosetta compiles the code into Django-friendly translations.

## Tests

Run all tests from the root folder:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker-compose.yml run --rm app
```

You can also run a collection of tests, like so:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker-compose.yml run --rm app pytest tests/test_person.py
```

Or run a single test, like so:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker-compose.yml run --rm app pytest tests/test_person.py::test_no_existing_sources
```

## Using the Google Sheet import script

If you're reading this and you're asking yourself, "Why on earth would I ever
want to import data into this system from a Google Sheet? What a nightmare!"
well, greetings from the past where that was a regular feature of our routine.
However, it was not as bad as you might think thanks to the brilliant work of
the SFM team.

The script to import data from a Google Sheet exists as a management command
within the `sfm_pc` directory of this project predictably called
`import_google_doc`. Before actually running the script, you'll need to take
a few steps.

The google sheets need to follow this format: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Kap4YtzWPtCdJy-iknF1aDaoIDMij4GU8E2-HlZkAo/edit#gid=597380077

**Import OpenStreetMap data**

As the Google Sheet importer is importing, it is creating relationships between
the various entities within the data and OSM nodes, ways and relations. In
order to speed that process up, we bulk download the data and insert it into
the location data table directly (rather than making API calls for every lookup
or some such thing). To do that, update your settings file so that it includes
the countries you'd like to import. You should see a setting called `OSM_DATA`
that includes a list of dictionaries that look like this:

```
{
    'country': 'Mexico',
    'pbf_url': 'http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/mexico-latest.osm.pbf',
    'relation_id': '114686',
    'country_code': 'mx',
}
```

* `country` is the nice name for the country
* `pbf_url` is a location on the internet where you can download a PBF snapshot
  of the OSM data for that country (we've been using Geofabrik and it's been
  working just fine)
* `relation_id` is the OSM id for the relation that represents the country's
  boundary
* `country_code` is the two letter ISO country code for the country

Once you have that sorted out, you'll need to make sure you have `osm2pgsql`
installed (this is the command line tool we use under the hood to turn the PBF
file into a PostgreSQL table). Once that is installed, you should be able to
run the `import_osm` management command:

```
python manage.py import_osm
```

If you're importing more than one country, this process can take a few hours,
depending on what kind of coverage each country has in OSM.

**Import data from Google Sheet**

This management command relies upon a [Service
Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts)
having access to the spreadsheet. Luckily, one is already setup, you just need
to go into the permission settings for the spreadsheet and give it read access.
If you decrypt the `credentials.json` file within the `configs` folder of this
project, you'll see that there is a `client_email` key. This is the email
address that you'll use to give the service account read access to the
spreadsheet.

Once that is setup, you should decrypt and copy the `credentials.json` file to
the same folder where the file for the management command is stored:

```
gpg -d configs/credentials.json.gpg
> sfm_pc/management/commands/credentials.json
```

One more thing to do before running the Google Sheet importer. You'll need to
get the document ID for the sheet that you want to import plus the sheet that
contains the sources. If you open up those sheets in a browser, you should be
able to grab the document ID from the URL:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<doc id (very long hash looking thing)>/edit
```

Once you have those, you should be able to run the importer like so:

```
docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py import_google_doc --source_doc_id <source doc id> --doc_id
<doc id for the doc you want to import>
```

## Importing new data without disrupting servers

This repo has a system for performing fresh data imports without disrupting
the normal activity of the server.

On every deploy, our build scripts create a separate directory, `sfm-importer`. This
directory is a copy of the app that uses a separate database with the name `importer`.
We'll use this database for our imports, so that the server can keep on serving
data normally during that process (which can take up to 8 hours!)

To perform a new import, start by creating a tmux session so your work doesn't
get interrupted. Then, activate the virtualenv for the project and change to the
`sfm-importer` directory:

```
tmux new -s fresh-import

# remember to switch to the correct user instead of <user>
sudo su - <user>
workon sfm
cd sfm-importer
make update_db
python manage.py make_flattened_views --recreate
python manage.py update_search_index
```

Finally, switch the `sfm` and `importer` databases:

```
# Renames the databases in a transaction -- the app doesn't need to stop
psql importer < sfm_pc/management/commands/flush/rename.sql
```

Presto! A fresh import, with no server downtime.
