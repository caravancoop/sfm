            Nigeria has security forces with different responsibilities for internal security. Crime fighting is the prime responsibility of the Nigeria Police Force. The State Security Service focuses on threats to national security. The Nigerian Armed Forces, comprising the Nigerian Air Force, Nigerian Army and Nigerian Navy, are also very active in internal security operations, particularly against Boko Haram. The Nigerian Army is generally the branch most closely involved in internal security operations. Security forces in Nigeria are generally national in character with the President of Nigeria as the commander-in-chief of the respective forces.

            The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is the national police force of Nigeria. The NPF is under control of the president and headed by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) who is appointed by the President. The command structure flows from the IGP at Force Headquarters through Zonal Police Commands, each of which oversee police operations in at least two states and/or the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Each State and the FCT has a Police Command headed by a Commissioner of Police who commands police operations in the state or FCT. Each Police Command also has a Criminal Investigation Department and a Special Anti Robbery Squad (the command structure for Special Anti Robbery Squad units has changed multiple times). Police Commands are divided into several Police Area Commands which are under the command of the Police Command. Police Area Commands are further divided into Police Divisions, which usually headed by a Chief Superintendent of Police and often referred to by their title, Divisional Police Officer. Police Divisions can also be under the direct command of their respective Police Command. Police Divisions in turn command the smaller formation of Police Stations which in turn command Police Posts. The smallest formation of the NPF is the Village Police Post which can be commanded by either a Police Post or Police Division, depending on the structure of the police formations in that particular area.

            The Department of State Security or State Security Service (DSS or SSS) is responsible for maintaining internal order and operates nationwide. The SSS is broken up into state commands headed by a Director of Security (commonly referred to as Director). The state commands are then under the command of the Director General of the SSS. The state commands may be further divided into branches covering each local government area of a state or the FCT.

            The President of Nigeria is the Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces, and generally commands the forces through the Chief of Defense Staff who heads Defence Headquarters.

Each Brigade generally has three battalions or artillery regiments under its command as well as a Garrison unit. (The deployment of forces to the north east to battle Boko Haram has complicated the picture somewhat).
