            WhoWasInCommand.com is a free, public database of police, military
            and other security and defence forces. It was created and is run by
            <a href="https://securityforcemonitor.org/" target="_blank">Security Force Monitor</a> -
            we are an investigative research project based at the
            <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute" target="_blank">Human Rights Institute</a>
            at Columbia Law School in New York. WhoWasInCommand.com contains detailed data
            we have created about the organizational structure, command personnel,
            and geographic footprint of police, military and other security and defence forces.
            We have created all this data by analyzing public sources. Additionally,
            we structure and compile allegations made publicly by civil society groups
            of alleged human rights violations committed by security and defence forces.

            We created WhoWasInCommand.com to solve a major problem we had experienced
            in our own work: there is a huge amount of publicly available data about the
            security and defence forces of many countries of the world, but it is
            unstructured and scattered amongst a wide variety of sources. This makes it
            prohibitively costly for people who do public interest work to understand
            the security and defence forces of a particular country. You can read more
            about this problem and why we started Security Force Monitor in
            <a href="https://securityforcemonitor.org/2017/04/11/why-i-started-the-security-force-monitor/" target="_blank">this blog we posted in 2017</a>.

            To address the problem, we search for this information, analyze it,
            structure it and publish it here on WhoWasInCommand.com where it can
            help answer questions like:

            security forces, reporting from domestic and international media,
            academic research and civil society reports. You can see the sources

            in New York. Our work is financed through grants from funders including

            Our aim is to make police, military and other security forces around
            the world more transparent and accountable. We do this by analyzing
            and structuring public information on the security forces to show
            their organizational structure, geographical footprint and operational
            jurisdiction, their command personnel and their potential connections
            to alleged human rights violations documented by organizations like
            Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

            The opaque nature of most security forces means that investigators
            face a common challenge of connecting abuses committed by security
            forces to a specific perpetrator. Access to detailed information on
            the security forces helps human rights groups to name specific
            perpetrators when abuses occur. When civil society can make specific
            allegations a host of accountability mechanisms can be set in motion,
            including: seeking restrictions on security assistance from external
            providers, naming and shaming advocacy, and international criminal cases.
