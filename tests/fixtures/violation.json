The men were taken to the State Intelligence and Investigation Bureau (SIIB) in Port Harcourt. On the same day, the Joint Task Force raided Boma Augustine Fingesi\u2019s house, broke windows, doors and ceiling boards and took some property including cash. Two days after his arrest, a family member was contacted by a police officer. \u201cThis police officer asked me if I knew that he had been shot in the legs and said that he wanted to help him\u201d, she told Amnesty International. \u201cI asked for whatever assistance the policeman could give. He asked for \u000250,000.\u201d Family members saw images of Boma Augustine Fingesi in the newspapers and on television. \u201cMost of the articles described him as a suspected kidnapper. On TV\u2026pictures of him were broadcast and it was alleged that he is a kidnapper. All this happened at the police headquarters. I saw how they humiliated, assaulted him in public and made him look like a criminal on television. I could not watch this. I was just crying.\u201d On 24 November 2008, after more than a month in custody without seeing a judge, 16 suspects were released, but Boma Augustine Fingesi remained in custody. A police officer told the family that they \u201cshould wait and leave that matter for now.\u201d However, later the police said that Boma Augustine Fingesi was no longer in detention and that he had been released on bail. There was no document to confirm his release and the police could not say who had bailed him. \u201cThe police then changed their story and said that he had never been brought to the police station,\u201d said a relative. \u201cThis is the big controversy. Earlier on, the police had said clearly that he was in their custody only to change the story later. They have forgotten that all the papers covered the story and there is no way they can deny knowledge of this case.\u201d A bail application was filed and on 13 January 2009, the court granted him bail. However, the police did not release him. Even after the Rivers State Branch of CLO wrote a petition to the IGP on 23 February and 19 May 2009, no explanation was received. At the time of writing, there still is no sign of Boma Augustine Fingesi.\"", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationdivisionid", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": null, "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "ocd-division/country:ng", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationenddate", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "2009-12-09", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationlocation", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": null, "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "SRID=4326;POINT (7.0188527133220804 4.7676575482289900)", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationperpetratorclassification", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "Police", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationstartdate", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "2008-10-15", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationtype", "pk": 1, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 1, "value": "Violations against the right to liberty", "sources": ["1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343", "1024da40-4c61-40e1-9e28-c75fb3dc6343"], "accesspoints": ["955650f8-8811-43b8-9757-a4a47ac26558"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationdescription", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "According to Amnesty International: \"Chibuike Anams, a student aged 23, was sitting with two friends at a guesthouse in Elimgbu, Rivers State, on 24 July 2009.

A journalist told Human Rights Watch that he saw the commander of the military task force in Maiduguri, Col. Ben Ahanotu, arrive at police headquarters that morning with Foi in the back of a white Toyota Hilux pickup truck. After dropping Foi off, Ahanotu drove away, leaving the captive standing in the compound, his hands tied behind his back, with Borno State Police Commissioner Christopher Dega and a group of mobile police officers. The journalist said Dega ordered Foi to be taken inside, but some of the mobile police officers refused and instead shot him: The police commissioner said they should take him to CID [Criminal Investigation Department]. He then went back to his office. Some of the junior officers shouted, \u201cLet us kill him!\u201d They said, \u201cWe will not allow him to go.\u201d\u2026 I saw the commissioner of police come [back] down from the upstairs office.
