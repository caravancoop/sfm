We said no\u2026They said \u2018you killed our colleague and you refused to tell us!\u2019 and then they started beating us. They said \u2018all of you are dead. We are going to kill all of you.\u2019 They started beating us and asked us to take off our clothes. And then they asked us to roll on the floor. They then used their bayonet and knives to cut our backs. I saw one soldier cutting the back of six people close to me. Many of us were already bleeding because we got wounded by rolling on sharp stones and other objects on the floor. The soldiers then took us to Guantanamo. \u2026We were about 57 in the cell. And then the soldier hit me with a stick. He said \u2018you Boko Haram, why you\u2019re hiding your face? Look at me! Are you Boko Haram?\u2019 I said no. he hit me again on my head. \u2026. They kept asking whether I was Boko Haram, I kept saying no. They\u2019ll shout \u2018liar!\u2019 They asked me where I was when the MOPOL was killed, I told them I don\u2019t know. They said you don\u2019t know where you were? They started beating me harder. All five of them. They kicked me. They hit my head with a stick. They beat me on my back, my stomach, on my legs, everywhere they could lay their weapons on. I was just lying there. When they realized there was so much blood on the floor, they brought some bucket of cold water and poured it on me. It was very painful. All the wounds on my body started aching afresh.

There, they stripped him, ripped his undershirt in half, and blindfolded him with it. Then they handcuffed his hands behind his back. \u201cThey started beating me from everywhere,\u201d al-Shuweikh said, \u201cAt first I wanted to be hard-headed and I wasn\u2019t going to talk. They started beating me with the wooden sticks and started cursing my mother. And then they started saying, \u2018We'll do X, Y and Z if you don't talk.\u2019\u201d They shocked him with an electric stun gun and put him into another room for half an hour. Afterward, they brought him into the office of the head of investigations. Inside the office, they hung al-Shuweikh from the ceiling and suspended him so that his feet did not touch the floor, dislocating his right shoulder. After confirming al-Shuweikh\u2019s identity, the interrogators asked him whether he belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood and to give them the identities of those they claimed helped organize activism in the university and paid him to protest. Al-Shuweikh tried to give the interrogator answers that would not incriminate his friends, but it seemed as though the police did not believe him. The interrogator began to squeeze his testicles. \u201cI started answering the questions because I was in a lot of pain,\u201d al-Shuweikh said. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t want to give them names, and then I started creating fake names and giving them to them.\u201d The interrogator said that al-Shuweikh was not being truthful, and the men threw him into another room. They soon pulled him out and put him into an office with a different interrogator. \u201cThis was a different situation,\u201d al-Shuweikh said. \u201cIt was as if there was personal rivalry between us.\u201d The men in this room forced al-Shuweikh to the floor, pulled down his pants and underwear, and inserted their fingers in his anus. Then they inserted what felt like a wooden stick. \u201cNow look at what we're doing to you,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cYou were acting like a man outside, you were taking your shirt off and saying the Interior Ministry are thugs. Here we are and we're fucking you. We'll make you pregnant.\u201d This initial experience lasted for about six minutes, after which the officers continued the interrogation for around three hours, al-Shuweikh said. The officers hung him in a stress position, shocked his testicles, hands, and his handcuffs with electricity, raped him with a stick, and squeezed his testicles. During the interrogation, one officer led the torture, while a different officer tried to persuade al-Shuweikh to talk. \u201cMy son, we want to help you, don\u2019t worry, we'll get you out, just help us,\u201d the second officer said, according to al-Shuweikh. He told al-Shuweikh he knew there were people paying them to protest. \u201cWho is fooling you with the money? We know that you have nothing to do with it, but we know someone is paying you,\u201d he said. When al-Shuweikh did not answer, they would torture him again. Al-Shuweikh believed that the National Security officers at this station had a special interest in him. He could hear them speaking on radios or mobile phones to other people whom he assumed to be police officers, telling them that al-Shuweikh was \u201ctheirs\u201d and they would be \u201cdealing with him\u201d at the station, not transferring him. At one point, an officer asked him if he wanted anything to eat or drink or to \u201cfreshen up\u201d before he would be filmed making a confession. He said no. A man entered the room with a video camera and turned it on. An officer asked al-Shuweikh questions, telling him to admit to being a Brotherhood member. Al-Shuweikh responded that he did not know what the officer was talking about, and the man with the camera told the officer, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work, pasha.\u201d The officer told the man to proceed and that they would edit the footage later. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Say that a certain person was with you, we'll ask you about this and you will answer you were at this place,\u2019 So I said OK, [but then] they would start and I would say, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d al-Shuweikh said. The officer attempted to film his confession two or three times before stopping. After the first day\u2019s interrogation ended, they put al-Shuweikh in a room by himself. They would not allow him to sleep and did not give him food or let him pray or use the bathroom. At around 9:30am the following day, they took him to a prosecutor\u2019s office in a courthouse in the Seventh District area of Madinat Nasr. Around five days later, al-Shuweikh\u2019s mother, Hoda Abd al-Hamid Mohamed, visited him at the police station. She told Human Rights Watch that al-Shuweikh was limping badly, and the left side of his face was swollen, nearly closing his left eye. She visited again the next day, and al-Shuweikh smuggled notes to her detailing his torture.", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationdivisionid", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": null, "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "ocd-division/country:eg", "sources": [], "accesspoints": []}}, {"model": "violation.violationenddate", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "2014-03-25", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationfirstallegation", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "2017-09-05", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationlocation", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": null, "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": 271613766, "sources": [], "accesspoints": []}}, {"model": "violation.violationlocationdescription", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "National Security offices in Second Police Station", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationperpetratorclassification", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "Police", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationstartdate", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "2014-03-24", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationtype", "pk": 4, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "Beating", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationtype", "pk": 3, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "Rape", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violationtype", "pk": 2, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 2, "value": "Torture", "sources": ["67fb992a-86c9-495a-a860-bcf5a46b8abf"], "accesspoints": ["211c9ec9-f8c2-4117-a5e0-2b2230c4cac8"]}}, {"model": "violation.violation", "pk": 181, "fields": {"uuid": "4417461d-86e4-478a-9177-0b5069d0be2e"}}, {"model": "violation.violationdescription", "pk": 296, "fields": {"lang": "en", "confidence": "1", "object_ref": 181, "value": "According to Amnesty International: \"MARCHERS SHOT, HEAD BRIDGE, ONITSHA, 2 DECEMBER 2015 - On 1 December, thousands of IPOB members and supporters held a protest on the Niger Bridge, also known as Head Bridge, a main bridge connecting Anambra and Delta states.
