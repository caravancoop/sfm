According to eyewitnesses, the men were told to take off their clothes. Wearing only their trousers, they were lined up and, one by one, told to close their eyes as they were pushed in front of a man seated in a vehicle. The man then indicated left or right. Thirty-five men were sent to the left, and the remaining 300 or so were sent to the right. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that the soldiers and members of the Civilian JTF then ordered the 35 men, whom they accused of being Boko Haram members, to lie down side by side on the ground, and started beating them with sticks and machetes. One eyewitness told Amnesty International that he heard one of the military officials shouting: \u201cYou have to beat, even kill these; they are Boko Haram.\u201d The men, eyewitnesses said, were then loaded into a single military truck and taken away. Video footage from the operation recorded on 23 July and later obtained by Amnesty International corroborates these accounts.

A little further away lies a man, seemingly unconscious or dead.
