The military took him to Giwa and returned to his house later that day for a search. His health deteriorated while in custody as he has diabetes and hypertension. Amnesty International wrote to the Commander of the JTF on 10 June 2013 to request that Alhaji be charged or released from detention, copying the Chief Defence Staff, the Attorney General of the Federation and the National Security Advisor. A reminder was sent on 11 October 2013. No response was received. His lawyer requested bail on 18 November 2013, but it was refused. On 22 January 2014, his lawyer filed a case in court requesting his release. Alhaji escaped after the attack on Giwa Barracks on 14 March 2014 and immediately reported himself at DSS in Maiduguri. His family went there and saw him. They were told that DSS would release him, but he was not released. On 10 July 2014, the judge ordered that Alhaji\u2019s arrest and detention was illegal and unconstitutional and that he should be released on bail. The judge signed a warrant requesting the DSS to produce Alhaji at the Federal High Court on 11 July 2014. In a letter dated 25 July 2014 and sent to the DSS in Maiduguri, the solicitors to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice stated they had no objection to his release. Still, he was not released. In October 2014 the family was told to come to DSS and sign his release papers. But instead of releasing him, the DSS handed him over to the military. A family member told Amnesty International: \u201cThey said we can\u2019t go with him, that the military would take him. They were coming out of the gate, in a black hilux with soldiers inside, tinted glass, no number plate. The soldiers didn\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t know where they were taking him, until after one month, we found out through some people that were released.\u201d The family continued to try and secure his release in court. \u201cThe military came to court. They said they don\u2019t know him, don\u2019t know who he is.

Ibrahim Bukar Tela, a shop owner, locked himself in his shop to try to protect himself. According to eyewitnesses, the JTF poured petrol around the shop and set it on fire, killing Ibrahim Bukar Tela. The eye witness testimony reported in newspapers contradicts the JTF\u2019s account of the incident. A press statement released by the spokesman of the JTF Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, which confirmed the blast, said that an improvised explosive device (IED) exploded when a convoy of JTF vehicles was passing on the main road.
